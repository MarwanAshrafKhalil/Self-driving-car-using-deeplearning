# Self-Driving car using deeplearning
An Embdedd systems project for self-driving car using deeplearning, in this project we a Nvidia Jetson Nano microprocessor and Pi-camera V2 were used in addition to motors and wheels.

The edge in this project:
1-to make a dataset for Egyptian car plates manually and train SSD mobilenet V2 model.
2-Detect the distance between and the car and the cars in the surrounding area by using a single camera only without the need of using a stereo camera.

The model was trained on Google Colab reaching accuracy 90%, it was trained to detect car plates, traffic signs and pedestrains. 
the accuracy of the model could be increase by increasing the size of dataset but as a proof of concept it was accepted.

Feel free to ask if you have any questions related to these kinds of projects.
